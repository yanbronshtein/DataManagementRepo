    "In this homework you will be working with json data and TinyDB. The overall task is to query the Citibikes NYC server ( https://gbfs.citibikenyc.com/gbfs/en/station_status.json ), store the data in a TinyDB database, and infer activities for the stations. Sample starter code relating to these subtasks was discussed in class.\n",

    "\n",
    "You may query the data, save the results in 3 JSON files on your laptop, load the JSON files as JSON Objects, and then insert them into the database. This approach may be easier rather than querying the data live each time you test the code.\n",

    "Your submission should consist of both the ipynb file and the json file. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>IMPORTANT</b> (1) Make sure that your code is organized, documented, and contains only what is being asked for in the question. (2) This homework requires you to run the code at three different times of a day (preferably a weekday), so make sure that you start the homework early.  "
